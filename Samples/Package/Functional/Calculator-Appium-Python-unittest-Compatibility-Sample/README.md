# Calculator Compatibility Test Package (Appium Python unittest Test Cases)
## Calculator
Calculator is a sample app which is being tested. Click [here](../../../../Sample-App-Src/Calculator) for details of Calculator.

## Appium Test Project
This package sample includes one functional test Script: [CalculatorTest.py](./Tests). CalculatorTest.py is a python functional test script based on the '**unittest**' Test Framework to run and validate basic UI scenarios on **Calculator** application. It highlights the following basic interactions to demonstrate how UI testing using [Windows Application Driver](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinAppDriver).
- Creating a modern UWP app session
- Finding element using name
- Finding element using XPath
- Sending click action to an element
- Retrieving element value

*A Functional test executes your uploaded test script(s) on your package. The scripts are run in the sequence you specified and a failure in a particular script will stop subsequent scripts from executing.*

### Compatibility test cases
It is used to test your app's compatibility with Windows. For example:
- Create new desktop and launch it from different desktop
- Search App by Windows Search
- Max/Min your app
- Pin/Unpin your app to Start/TaskBar
- Open/Close your app from TaskBar

### Take Screenshots
The example cases also implements how to **take screenshots** during testing.You can add the follow code where you want to take a screenshot in your cases(The path is designed by yourself):
```
   self.driver.get_screenshot_as_file(self._testMethodName +'.png')
```
After completing the test.You will get the Screenshot files under your target filefolder and here is the example screenshot from our example test case:
![searchCalculator](.\test_searchCalculator.png)

### Prerequsites
To run python scripts, you need to install:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

To be able to develop new test cases, what else you need:
- Windows 10 PC with the latest Windows 10 version (Version 1809 or later)

To run test cases, following the guide to [install and run Windows Application Driver](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppDriver/blob/master/README.md#installing-and-running-windows-application-driver).

To run test cases, You need to uninstall the calculator application that comes with your system first.
